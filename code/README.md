## PYSEG SYSTEM (v 0.2.a)

PySeg system contains software for template-free macromolecule localization, structural and quantiative organization analysis 
for cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) data. 

**IMPORTANT:** Proficiency in Python programming language is required to use all capabilities contained in PySeg, as GUI is not available at this point. PySeg is an open source project, contributions are welcome.
