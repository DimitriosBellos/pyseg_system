 Additional and modified scripts in respect to **synth_somb** to process **s**ingle **o**riented **m**em**b**ranes from **exp**erimental data.
 
 * **pre_tomo_seg.py**: pre-processing for mb_graph_batch.py of oriented membranes from TomoSegMemTV output.
 * **mb_graph_batch.py**: script for extracting an analyzing a GraphMCF with a segmented membrane.
 * **mb_fils_network.py**: script for filter a MbGraphMCF object by extracting a filament network for single oriented membrane.
 * **mbo_picking.py**: script for extracting particles from a filament network of a oriented single membrane graph.
 * **post_rec_particles.py**: script for post-processing already reconstructed particles (it includes the posibilty of membrane suppression).
